            <h1>About the Authors</h1>
            <p>This research project was conducted by the <i>NI<sup>2</sup>L</i> under the supervision of <strong>Dr. Jun Cai</strong>, a leading expert in wireless communications and network intelligence. Over the past six years (since 2019), Dr. Cai has authored or co-authored more than 50 peer-reviewed journal articles—including eight in <i>IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</i> and one in <i>IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)</i>—alongside 24 international conference papers, two books, one edited volume, and three book chapters. His academic leadership has been recognized through five keynote addresses at flagship conferences, editorial board memberships for six journals, chairing seven international conferences, and serving on the technical program committees of 56 global events. In 2024, he was named an IEEE Vehicular Technology Society Distinguished Lecturer.</p>

            <p>Dr. Cai's research focuses on advanced radio resource management for next-generation wireless networks, encompassing areas such as human digital twins, edge/cloud computing, 5G/6G architectures, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). His work spans both rigorous theoretical modeling and practical system design. Contact: <a href="mailto:jun.cai@concordia.ca">jun.cai@concordia.ca</a></p>

            <p>The team’s knowledge synthesis focuses on two major axes identified by the program: <strong>Technologique</strong> and <strong>Impacts sociaux</strong>. These were selected based on their strategic importance to Quebec’s evolving connectivity landscape.</p>
