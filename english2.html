      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In an era of unprecedented digital transformation, connectivity is the cornerstone of economic growth, social progress, and the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). Reliable internet access and advanced communication technologies are no longer optional; they are essential drivers of productivity and innovation across key sectors such as education, healthcare, and smart infrastructure. Yet, remote and underserved areas of Québec still face connectivity barriers, constrained by geographical and economic challenges.</p>
      <p>Recognizing these persistent barriers, the Government of Québec has introduced the <em>Partnership Research Program: Scientific Studies on Connectivity – Knowledge Synthesis</em>. This forward-thinking initiative not only aims to enhance high-speed internet coverage and next-generation communication services but also drives the development of emerging technologies through policy-driven investments and infrastructure optimization. By fostering technological innovation and spurring economic growth, this program aspires to secure Québec’s competitive edge in the rapidly evolving global digital landscape.</p>
      <p>Despite these concerted efforts, critical obstacles remain. These include insufficient investment in research and development, inefficiencies in infrastructure coordination, and concerns over the equitable distribution of technological benefits. Preserving Québec’s leadership in the international digital economy requires a balanced approach that advances cutting-edge solutions while safeguarding broader societal interests. Through an in-depth analysis of <strong>Technological</strong> and <strong>Social impacts</strong>, this study aims to fortify Québec’s strategic objectives and pave the way for sustained inclusive growth.</p>
